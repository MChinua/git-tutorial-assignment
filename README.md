# git-tutorial-assignment
A Start of my tech journey

Posted by Mchinua

'git' is a very useful tool every dev should know how to use.
When working in a team, you should know how to collaborate and use all tools needed and available, which git will likely be among.
git helps you track every step of journey in coding project, should incase you need to retrace your step.
the step by step class was really a good guide for me and i want to appreciate blockchain UNN for this.
start from the SOFTWARE HACK EVERY DEVELOPER SHOULD KNOW documents well explained to the INTRODUCTION TO GIT AND GETTING STARTED WITH GIT HUB.
The Commands line can be quite tricky so i used the terminal on my VS code.
Consistent Practice would do every up coming developer good.

THANK YOU, BLOCKCHAIN UNN!
